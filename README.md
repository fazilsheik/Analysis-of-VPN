##  Steps Performed

### 1. Choose a Reputable Free VPN
- **Selected VPN**: [ProtonVPN Free](https://protonvpn.com)
- Reasons: Trustworthy, no logs, strong encryption, free tier available.

### 2. Download and Install the VPN Client
- Created a free ProtonVPN account.
- Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client for Windows.

### 3. Connect to a VPN Server
- Logged in to ProtonVPN client.
- Used "Quick Connect" to connect to the nearest free VPN server.

### 4. Verify IP Address Change
- Visited [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) before and after VPN connection.
- **Observed Result**: IP address and location changed after VPN connection.

### 5. Confirm Encrypted Browsing
- Browsed websites like [wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org) and [google.com](https://www.google.com).
- Verified successful and secure page loads with VPN active.

### 6. Compare Speed and IP Without VPN
- Disconnected VPN.
- Verified real IP reappeared.
- Used [https://fast.com](https://fast.com) to compare browsing speeds:
  - **With VPN**: Slight speed drop observed.
  - **Without VPN**: Regular speed restored.

##  VPN Encryption and Privacy Features

- **Encryption Protocols**: OpenVPN, IKEv2, WireGuard (ProtonVPN supports WireGuard for fast and secure connections).
- **Kill Switch**: Blocks internet if VPN disconnects.
- **No-Log Policy**: Ensures user activity is not stored or tracked.
- **DNS Leak Protection**: Prevents DNS queries from leaking outside the VPN tunnel.
Summary: VPN Benefits and Limitations

 Benefits
- Hides real IP address and location.
- Encrypts traffic on public Wi-Fi networks.
- Bypasses geo-restrictions and censorship.
- Adds anonymity for sensitive browsing.

 Limitations
- Internet speed may decrease.
- Free versions may have server/data limits.
- Some streaming services block VPN traffic.
- VPNs are not a substitute for full anonymity or antivirus.


Using a VPN enhances privacy and security, especially on unsecured networks or when accessing region-blocked content. However, users should understand the trade-offs in speed and limitations of free services.
